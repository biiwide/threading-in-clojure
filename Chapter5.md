## Agents

   *Agent* Like an atom such that it will represent some state of an identity at some point in time, but can be asynchronous. For example you can keep
sending work to an agent and carry on with your program.

(Talk about difference atom and stage which is basically asych versus synch)

(Give time to write an agent implementation, after 10 minutes go through it together live)
